## General info
Course content from the introduction to algorithms course. These projects are a combination of Python and C++.The main textbook of the course was CLRS. Discussed subjects were: Divide and Conquer / Dynamic programming / Greedy algorithms / Network flow / P and NP space
	
## Technologies
There are 4 projects within this repository which are as follows:
* CA#1: Two mini problems on sorting. The first one was coded using Python ,and the second one using C++. (due to the time constraints for runtime)
* CA#2: Three mini problems about dynamic programming. All coded in C++.
* CA#3: Two mini problems about graphs. Both coded in Python.
* CA#4: Three mini problems about graph traversal methods such as BFS. All coded in Python.
